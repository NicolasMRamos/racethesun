# University Project - Race The Sun (Java Game)

This group project consists on an game I developed for the Laborat√≥rio de Design e Teste de Software (LDTS) class in my second year, first semester in FEUP.

## Description

Race the Sun is an infinite game that challenges your reaction capabilities. In command of a small racing ship, the objective of the player is to go as far as possible without crashing into the obstacles in the way.

It's based on the game Race the Sun, developed by Flippfly. The game is playable in mobile and PC, in Steam.

* Menus - The game has a main menu and a death menu that appears after colliding with an obstacle.

* Movement - The ship moves forward automatically, and the player can only move it left and right.

* Obstacles - Colliding with an obstacle causes the player to lose the game.

* Procedural Generation - As the player progresses, obstacles are generated automatically and randomly.

* Map Grid - Helps the player understand where they are and where they can proceed.
